# 1) Lets create a class, use pass and create a class! Then use 
#    __init__ think of the key attributes of it
    # Global class variables
    # Init, runs on creating this class
    # Methods!
    # Properties
    # Takes inputs, functions
    # Orders matters, check documentation linked below!
    # Class Methods!

    # This runs when we run print on the class
        
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # 2) Now lets instantiate a few of them. A question is, are they the same?
    # 3) Global Class variables???
    # 4) Using self
    # 5) Creating a method for this class
    # 6) Using __repr__
    # 7) Using Properties, property(), to set setters and getter functions (https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/property)
    # 8) Decorators and CLS (@classmethod)
